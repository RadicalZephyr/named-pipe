Named Pipe for Boost.Interprocess
=================================

This is the repo for an ISP I'm doing on building a basic
cross-platform named-pipe implementation.  One of the design goals is
that it eventually be included in the Boost.Interprocess library.

Ideas and suggestions (and pull requests!) welcome!
